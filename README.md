# Math game

## Overview
**Simple Math** is a math game that allows the user to select between game modes (+, -, *, /) and solve randomly generated problems.

## Features
- Utilizes Tkinter to create windows and a decent GUI that is easy to understand
- Allows the user to select between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Randomly selects numbers and prints them on a screen (decently decorated) so the user can answer
- Takes in user input for the answer and a submit button that checks answers.
- Displays results and the correct answer (answer only shown if the user was incorrect)
- After submission, the submit button is temporarily disabled until refreshed to prevent cheating/spamming.
- Refresh button to generate new numbers
- Exception handling, the code will not accept anything other than numbers

## Why I Built It
I built this math game to test my knowledge of basic Python and explore new aspects of the language. Recently, I have just completed a
course about the basics of programming, which was a solid foundation. However, I soon grew tired of making boring, visually unappealing
programs. I also felt extremely limited as I could only use one file for code, and I didn't know anything beyond simple console programs.
I made this app as a challenge to push my knowledge. For the first time, I used multiple different files to piece the program together
and built the app while learning tkinter.

## Future Improvements
- I believe I am done working with this project for now as I am satisfied. It was a great learning journey and a great starting point, but I am going to focus on future projects. To me this project was more of a "step-in-a-new-direction" rather than a long-term one.
